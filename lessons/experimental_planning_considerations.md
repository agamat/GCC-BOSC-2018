## Experimental planning considerations

Understanding the steps in the experimental process of RNA extraction and preparation of RNA-Seq libraries is helpful for designing an RNA-Seq experiment, but there are special considerations that should be highlighted that can greatly affect the quality of a differential expression analysis. These considerations include:

- Replicates
- Confounding
- Batch effects
