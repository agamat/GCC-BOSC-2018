## Experimental planning considerations

Understanding the steps in the experimental process of RNA extraction and preparation of RNA-Seq libraries is helpful for designing an RNA-Seq experiment, but there are special considerations that should be highlighted that can greatly affect the quality of a differential expression analysis. 

These important considerations include:

1. Number and type of **replicates**
2. Avoiding **confounding**
3. Addressing **batch effects**
